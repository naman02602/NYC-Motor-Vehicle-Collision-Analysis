## Dataset
The data comes from police reports, which NYPD is required to fill out when someone is killed, injured or there is a damage of at least $1000 in an accident. It is a large dataset of approximately 396 MB and reports accidents from July 2012 through May 2021.

## Data Profiling
Data profiling is like studying data closely. It's about looking at data to understand what's inside, like checking its types and patterns and also if there is any missing data. This helps us know the data better and decide how to use it for different tasks.
